# Hello, I'm Juan 👋

I'm **Juan Mata**, a passionate **Multiplatform Application Developer** who enjoys building software that solves real-world problems. I love learning new technologies, improving my skills every day, and creating applications that combine clean code with good design.

I work on projects both **independently and in teams**, and I’m especially interested in **cross-platform development**, **web applications**, **mobile apps**, and **desktop solutions**.  
Many of my projects are developed **in my free time**, where I experiment with new tools, frameworks, and ideas.

Currently, I focus on **Java**, **.NET (C#, WPF, .NET MAUI)**, **Angular**, **Laravel**, and **Python**, aiming to build **scalable, maintainable, and multiplatform applications**.

If you'd like to collaborate, share ideas, or just talk about tech, feel free to reach out!
