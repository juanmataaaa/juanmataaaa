# Hey there 👋

I'm **Juan Mata**, a passionate **Multiplatform Application Developer** who loves creating software that solves real-world problems. I'm always exploring new technologies, improving my skills, and building apps and games that combine creativity with solid code.

I enjoy working both independently and as part of a team, and I'm especially interested in **cross-platform development**, **mobile applications**, and **desktop solutions**. I'm currently focusing on **Java**, **.NET MAUI**, **C#**, and **Python**, and I thrive on learning something new every day.

If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or just talk about code, feel free to reach out!
